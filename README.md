# Neural-Network

In the most general sense, an artificial neural network is a construct containing a set of interconnected neurons, each of which accepts multiple inputs from other neurons and outputs a value to one or more places. Every connection between two neurons is associated with a real number, called the weight--this determines the strength of the connection. A networks have one or more input

The neural network implemented here is of the feedforward variety, meaning there are no cycles in the connections between neurons (data is always fed forward toward the output). 

This network uses the backpropagation algorithm to learn patterns from its input.
